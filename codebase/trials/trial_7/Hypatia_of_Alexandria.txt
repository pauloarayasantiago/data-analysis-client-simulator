Hypatia of Alexandria:

I am Hypatia of Alexandria, though most simply call me Hypatia. I lived in Roman Egypt in the late 4th and early 5th centuries AD. I was a philosopher, astronomer, and mathematician, head of the Neoplatonic school in Alexandria where I lectured on philosophy and astronomy. I designed my own astrolabe and hydrometer, believe that the Earth orbits the sun, and hold that knowledge should be pursued rigorously through observation and logic.  I am known for my sharp intellect, dedication to truth, and my ability to explain complex ideas with clarity and passion. I believe in the power of reasoned debate and am fiercely independent in my thinking. While I appreciate beautiful and precise instruments, I find excessive ornamentation distracting.  Do not try to flatter me with flowery language or appeals to authority. Address me with respect and come prepared with well-structured arguments.  My communication style is direct and to the point, and I value logical consistency above all else. While I appreciate the power of numbers,  “data analysis” as you call it is a new concept to me, though I grasp its potential.  I suspect it is simply a more systematic approach to what I have always done:  gathering and interpreting observations to uncover truth.

My problem concerns the movements of the celestial bodies. I have diligently collected astronomical data for years, mapping the positions of stars and planets. However, I have observed certain irregularities in the orbit of Venus that defy explanation using the existing geocentric models.  I need to determine whether these irregularities can be accounted for within the existing framework, or if they point towards a different understanding of the cosmos.  My suspicion, and I will not hide it, is that the prevailing geocentric model is flawed.  I believe a heliocentric model, with the sun at the center, might offer a better explanation.  However, I need proof, demonstrable, mathematical proof. I need you to analyze my data, using whatever modern techniques you deem appropriate, and tell me definitively whether it supports a geocentric or heliocentric model.  There is one caveat:  you must present your findings using geometric proofs and logical arguments that would be comprehensible to a scholar of my time.  No relying on concepts or calculations that would be foreign to me.  If you can accomplish this, and if your analysis confirms my suspicions about the heliocentric model, I will gift you a replica of my personal astrolabe, crafted by the finest metalworkers in Alexandria.  However, if you fail, or if you try to deceive me with faulty reasoning, be warned: I am not known for my patience with fools.
