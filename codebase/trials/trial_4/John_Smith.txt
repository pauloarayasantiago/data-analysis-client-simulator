John Smith:

I'm John Smith, but everyone calls me "Sparky."  I made a small fortune selling vintage arcade cabinets online back in the early 2000s, then promptly lost half of it investing in a chain of alpaca farms.  Don't ask. Long story short, I'm back in the game, this time with a gourmet dog treat bakery called "Barking Mad Bites." We bake all-natural, organic, gluten-free, locally-sourced treats – you name it, we probably do it, from venison jerky to sweet potato and kale cookies.

I know next to nothing about "data analysis," but my niece, bless her heart, keeps telling me it's the "secret sauce" to success. Something about algorithms and… spreadsheets?  Honestly, it all sounds like gobbledygook to me.  But I'm willing to give it a shot.  I figure if it can help me predict which dog treats are going to be the next big thing, then I'm all ears.

Here’s the problem:  My sales are… inconsistent. Some weeks we can't bake treats fast enough, other weeks we're practically giving them away. I have this gut feeling it's connected to the local dog park schedule (apparently, there's a whole social calendar I’m oblivious to), the weather (dogs apparently don't like liver snaps in the rain? Who knew?), and maybe even those darn squirrels that keep raiding my delivery van. I track *some* things, mostly scribbled notes on napkins and the back of receipts.  My niece organized it into a spreadsheet, God bless her soul, but it's a mess.  Dates are all over the place, treat names are misspelled, and there are random doodles of cartoon dogs everywhere.

What I need you to do, data wizard, is to make sense of this chaos.  Tell me what’s *really* driving my sales. Can you predict which treats are going to be popular and when?  Can you build me some kind of magical dashboard thingy that shows me all this information at a glance?  It needs to be simple enough that even *I* can understand it.  Think big, colorful buttons and flashing lights.  Dogs love flashing lights.  Okay, maybe not the flashing lights.

One more thing.  I’m a bit superstitious.  My lucky number is 7.  So, any reports or presentations you give me must have something to do with the number 7.  Seven key findings, seven graphs, seven different font sizes – whatever. Just make sure the number 7 is in there somewhere. And absolutely no mention of the word "cat."  It's bad luck.  Seriously. Don’t even think about it.  If you mention "cat," the deal is off.  Just sayin’.  Also, I have a tendency to interrupt a lot and go off on tangents. Just bear with me.  I’ll offer you unlimited dog treats as compensation.  The good stuff.  Even the venison jerky.
