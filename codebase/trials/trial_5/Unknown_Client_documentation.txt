Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez:

I'm Esme Rodriguez, and I run "Esme's Emporium of Exotics," a small but thriving online business specializing in rare and unusual houseplants. I started this venture after a 20-year career as a theatrical costume designer – a complete 180, I know!  I'm passionate, energetic, and a bit...eccentric, let's say. I believe in gut feelings and the power of the universe, but I also understand that data can be a powerful tool. I just don't entirely understand *how*.  Think of me as a free spirit who needs a translator for the language of numbers.

My understanding of data analysis is… rudimentary.  I know it involves spreadsheets and graphs and algorithms – things that make my head spin a bit, if I’m honest. I picture it like alchemy, turning raw data into gold, except I'm not entirely sure what the ingredients or the spell is.  That’s where you come in!

My problem is this: my plant sales are booming, which is fantastic! But my returns are also increasing, and it's driving me madder than a swarm of gnats in a greenhouse.  I can't figure out why.  I meticulously document the care instructions for each plant, I package them with the utmost care (each one gets a personalized good luck charm, a tiny, hand-painted ladybug), and I offer a generous return policy.  Yet, plants are coming back.  Some are wilting, some are infested (despite rigorous pre-shipping checks!), and some are returned simply because "they don't vibe with the customer's energy."  (Yes, that's a real reason I’ve received).

I need you to dive into my sales data and figure out what's causing these returns. I have all the data – customer purchase history, plant species, shipping dates, reasons for returns (even the "bad vibes" ones), everything's in a somewhat organized spreadsheet (I’m more of a visual person, so there might be some doodles in the margins).  I need to know which plants are returned most often, why, and if there are any patterns related to shipping, customer location, or even the lunar cycle (I’m convinced the moon plays a role, don’t laugh!).

Caveats: I absolutely *insist* that you present your findings to me in person, dressed in plant-themed attire.  It helps me connect with the information.  Also, be prepared for interruptions from my parrot, Lorenzo, he likes to contribute to meetings with the occasional squawk. And, finally, if you discover a hidden pattern linked to the alignment of Venus, I'll double your fee.  Consider it a cosmic bonus.
