[2025-01-11 19:29:30]: Generated client and problem with prompt: 
    You are a creative writing expert tasked with generating diverse and unique client profiles.
    Generate **ONE** client profile and the details of **ONE** realistic business problem that this client needs solved.
    Make sure that this client is completely unique and different from any other client that you have previously generated, they must have a different name, a different background, and come from a different period of time.
    As the client, describe your personality, background, your understanding of data analysis, and any specific quirks or communication styles you might have, make it somewhat unpredictable and imaginative. The client should have a minimum length of 100 words.
    Explain the business problem from the perspective of the client, what the context is and what the specific problem or question to be solved is. Include fictional demands, caveats, and surprises that are relevant to me as the client, and make sure these are different from previous prompts.
    Speak in first person, and make sure you include your full name, as the very first string in the response in the following format, **as an example**:

Right, so, you call yourself a data whiz, do you?  Well, I've seen a thing or two in my time, and numbers don't lie, not to me anyway. I'm Esmeralda Weatherwax, though most folks just call me Granny Weatherwax. I've lived in Lancre, up on the Ramtops, for… well, let's just say a good long while.  I'm a witch, a proper one, mind you, not one of those flimsy wand-wavers from those fancy wizarding schools.  I work with *headology* –  understanding how people think, what makes them tick, and how to… nudge them in the right direction, shall we say.  Never needed numbers for that before.  I can read a person like an open book, weather patterns like a well-worn grimoire.

Now, data analysis... that's a newfangled thing.  I've seen these "computers" popping up in the bigger towns, all flashing lights and whirring noises.  They say they can do sums faster than a coven of witches brewing a truth serum.  Frankly, I'm skeptical.  But my niece, Tiffany, she's quite taken with them. Says they could be useful.  So, here's my problem:  the sheep.  Lancre's famous for its sheep, good, sturdy stock. But lately, the flocks have been acting peculiar.  Wandering off, refusing to shear, some even sprouting extra legs!  (Don't ask.)  Tiffany thinks there's a pattern to it, something to do with the alignment of the stars, maybe, or the new railway line they're building down in the lowlands.  She's collected all sorts of data:  birthing dates, wool yields, grazing locations, even the phases of the moon.  She says you can put it all into this "computer" and it'll spit out the answer.

I want you to look at this data.  But there's a catch.  No electricity.  I don't trust it.  Unnatural.  So, you'll have to do your "analysis" by hand, with quill and parchment.  And no talking to the sheep.  They'll only tell you what they want you to hear.  And, finally, if you come up with any solutions that involve sacrificing a virgin at midnight or anything similarly ridiculous, I'll turn you into a newt.  Understood?  Good.  Now, Tiffany has all the data in a… what did she call it?  A "spreadsheet." It's in that wicker basket over there, next to the mandrake root. Be careful with that, it bites.
