My name is Esmeralda "Esme" Rodriguez, and I own and operate "Esme's Emporium," a chain of five vintage clothing boutiques in the Los Angeles area.  I'm a bit of a whirlwind – high energy, passionate about fashion, and always ten steps ahead. I built this business from the ground up, starting with a tiny stall at the Rose Bowl Flea Market.  I'm not a tech whiz, but I understand that data is power. I've seen firsthand how trends shift, and I know there's valuable information hidden in my sales data. I tend to talk fast and jump from topic to topic, so please bear with me.  I also get very excited about beautiful visualizations – think vibrant colors and maybe even some animation!  It needs to *pop*.  Also, I'm a stickler for deadlines. I need this done by the end of next month, no exceptions.  My biggest pet peeve? Jargon.  Explain things to me like I'm five, please.

The problem? I *feel* like my inventory isn't optimized.  I'm constantly overstocked on certain items (like those 80s power suits – who knew they wouldn't fly off the shelves?) and understocked on others (apparently, everyone wants prairie dresses these days). My gut tells me there's a disconnect between what I *think* is trendy and what people are *actually* buying.  I need you to analyze my sales data from the past three years, across all five locations, and tell me exactly what I should be stocking and when.  I have all the data in Excel spreadsheets – one for each store, each year. They might be a little messy, fair warning.  Oh, and one more thing!  My daughter, Luna, is interning with me this summer. She's studying computer science and thinks she knows everything.  She'll be sitting in on our meetings and offering her "expert" opinion. Just… try to ignore her.

My name is Bartholomew "Bart" Higgins, and I'm the head librarian at the prestigious Oakhaven Academy for Boys. I'm a man of routine and order, and I believe in the power of knowledge – particularly the kind found in well-preserved books. I'm not entirely comfortable with this whole "data analysis" thing, but the school board insists it's necessary.  I prefer clear, concise communication, and I expect punctuality.  No surprises, please. I find them… unsettling.  I have a mild allergy to dust, so please ensure your attire is relatively lint-free when visiting the library.

Our problem is declining book circulation. Over the past five years, the number of books borrowed by students has steadily decreased.  The board is concerned and, frankly, so am I.  We have meticulous records of every book borrowed, going back decades.  It's all handwritten in ledgers, of course – we’re rather traditional here.  I need you to digitize these records – I can provide a scanning service if you don't have one – and analyze the data to understand why fewer books are being borrowed. Is it a decline in certain genres? Are specific age groups reading less?  I need actionable insights, not just fancy charts.  And please, no pie charts. I find them… aesthetically displeasing.  One final caveat:  the ledgers from 1987 are missing.  We suspect a squirrel took a liking to them.  Just… be aware of that gap in the data.
