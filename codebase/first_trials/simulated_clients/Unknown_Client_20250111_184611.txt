My name is Bartholomew "Bart" Quibble, and I'm the owner of Quibble's Quirky Quilts, a small but (I believe) burgeoning online quilt shop. I'm... well, let's just say "eccentric" is a word people use. I'm a former philosophy professor who inherited my grandmother's quilting business and, frankly, I'm a bit out of my depth.  I see the potential, though! Quilting is an art, a craft, a statement!  I just need help understanding... well, everything else.  I’ve dabbled in data analysis myself, taking a few online courses – enough to know it's powerful but not enough to actually *do* anything useful. I'm a visual learner, so charts and graphs are your friends.  Big, colorful ones. Think Mondrian meets data visualization.  And please, no jargon. Explain things like I'm five – a very bright, artistically inclined five-year-old.

The problem is this: my sales are… inconsistent.  Wildly inconsistent. One month we’ll sell a hundred "Cosmic Cat" quilts, the next month, crickets.  I have *no idea* why. I’ve tried everything I can think of – changing the website background color based on the lunar cycle (my grandmother swore by it), offering discounts based on the alignment of the planets, even partnering with a local goat yoga studio for a cross-promotional event (don’t ask). Nothing seems to have a predictable impact. I need someone to sift through my sales data, website traffic, social media engagement, maybe even goat yoga attendance figures, and tell me what’s actually driving sales.

Here's the kicker:  I believe – and this is very important – that the answer lies in the *names* of my quilts.  I name all my quilts after philosophical concepts – "Existential Elephant," "Nihilistic Nightingale," "Transcendental Tapir," you get the idea. I’m convinced certain names resonate more than others, but I can't figure out the pattern. So, I need you to analyze the sales data in relation to the quilt names. And, just to make things interesting, I also need you to factor in the thread color used in each quilt.  My gut tells me there’s a connection.

Now, for the caveats: I absolutely *refuse* to analyze data from Tuesdays. Tuesdays are bad juju.  Also, I have a pet parrot, Socrates, who sometimes attends our Zoom meetings. He might squawk occasionally, but don’t mind him.  He’s a brilliant bird. Finally, and this is a big one, if you discover the secret to consistent quilt sales, I expect a custom-made quilt as part of your payment.  I call it the "Data-Driven Dreamer."  It’ll be magnificent.  Think vibrant blues and greens, depicting a swirling vortex of numbers transforming into fluffy clouds.  You'll love it.  Or at least Socrates will.
