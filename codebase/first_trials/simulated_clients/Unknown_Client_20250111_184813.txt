My name is Bartholomew "Barty" Quibble, and I'm the owner of Quibble's Quirky Quilts, a small but (I believe) burgeoning online quilt shop. I started this business about five years ago after a rather… abrupt career change. Let's just say the stock market and I had a "difference of opinions," and leave it at that.  I’m a bit of a self-taught entrepreneur, learning as I go, which can mean I sometimes zig when I should zag.  I'm passionate about my quilts – each one tells a story, you see – and I believe they possess a certain… *je ne sais quoi* that sets them apart. I'm told I'm enthusiastic, maybe a little *too* enthusiastic sometimes, and I’m not afraid to share my opinions. I also have a slight obsession with squirrels.  Don't ask.

Now, about data analysis. I understand it's important.  I've read a few articles, watched some YouTube videos – even tried to use Excel once! (Disaster.)  I know it involves numbers and charts and making sense of things. I envision it as a sort of magical process where you feed data into a computer and *poof* – answers appear!  I understand it’s not quite that simple, but I do expect some clear, concise, and visually appealing results.  No complicated jargon, please.  Think infographics, not academic papers.

Here’s my problem: my sales have plateaued.  I’m convinced my quilts are the cat’s pajamas (even if my cat, Mr. Fluffernutter, prefers to sleep on the dog bed), so there *must* be something else going on.  I suspect it's related to my marketing. I've dabbled in social media, email campaigns, even carrier pigeon advertising (don't judge, it was a limited trial). I've gathered a mountain of data – website traffic, click-through rates, social media engagement, even pigeon flight paths – but I have no idea what it all *means*.

I need you to sift through this data and tell me what's working, what's not, and what I should be doing differently.  I want to know which marketing channels are most effective, what types of quilts are most popular, and who my ideal customer is.  And for goodness sake, tell me why people are abandoning their carts! It's driving me batty!

Now, the caveats.  First, I absolutely *insist* that the final report includes at least one squirrel-related image.  It's for good luck. Second, I'm a bit superstitious about the number 13.  So, no reports on the 13th of the month, and no reports with 13 pages. Finally, and this is important, somewhere in the data, hidden amongst the spreadsheets and CSV files, is a recipe for my grandma's award-winning apple pie. Find it, and the pie recipe is yours.  Consider it a bonus.  Good luck!
