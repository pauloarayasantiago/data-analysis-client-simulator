## Model Selection for Client Profile Generation

We chose **`gemini-1.5-pro-latest`** for generating client profiles and business problems for our data analysis simulations. This decision was based on the model's ability to create the most **realistic and practical** business scenarios compared to other models tested (`gemini-1.5-flash-latest` and `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`).

**Why `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`?**

*   Produces scenarios grounded in reality, making the data analysis tasks more relevant.
*   Generates clear and actionable business problems suitable for standard data analysis techniques.
*   Offers high-quality, coherent narratives, providing a solid foundation for building simulations.

**How the Model Selection Was Done:**

1. A prompt was designed to generate diverse client profiles and business problems.
2. This prompt was used with three different Gemini models: `gemini-1.5-pro-latest`, `gemini-1.5-flash-latest`, and `gemini-2.0-flash-exp`.
3. The outputs from each model were compared based on:
    *   Realism and practicality of the generated scenario.
    *   Coherence and detail of the narrative.
    *   Clarity and actionability of the business problem.
4. Based on this comparison, `gemini-1.5-pro-latest` was selected as the model that best aligns with the goal of creating realistic data analysis simulations.
